## start
To start the server, invoke ``npm start`` with whichever configuration you wish to use. E.G.:

    // Will default to 'dev' configuration if not specified.
    // Start with 'prod' configuration.
    CONF=prod npm start
    // Start with explicit 'dev' configuration.
    CONF=dev npm start

## hacking
Invoke ``gulp watch`` after starting the server to have your changes compiled as you work.
